## About 🤓

Data structures are the fundamental building blocks of software development. In this repository, we unravel the intricacies of linked lists, trees, graphs, and more. Expect profound concepts, elegant code, and a touch of creativity.

## Revision Files 📝

The revision files in this repository contain C++ code implementations of various data structures, along with different functions associated with them. Here are some of the available files: ☕
-  **Linked List**: A linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, and each node contains a value and a pointer to the next node.
- **Doubly Linked List**: A linked list where each node contains a pointer to both the next and previous nodes.

## OJ Assignments 🚀
Within the `OJ` folder, you will discover challenging exercises that will invigorate your cognitive faculties. Please refrain from duplicating these files, as it is akin to robbing your future self. Instead, channel your inner Sherlock Holmes, employing keen observation and deduction. 🔍
