## About ü§ì

Data structures are the fundamental building blocks of software development. In this repository, we unravel the intricacies of linked lists, trees, graphs, and more. Expect profound concepts, elegant code, and a touch of creativity.

## Revision Files üìù

The revision files in this repository contain C++ code implementations of various data structures, along with different functions associated with them. Here are some of the available files: ‚òï

- **Linked List**: A linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, each containing a value and a pointer to the next node.
- **Graph**: A collection of nodes connected by edges, representing various relationships between pairs of nodes.
- **Disjoint Set**: A data structure that keeps track of a partition of a set into disjoint subsets, supporting union and find operations.
- **Tree**: A hierarchical data structure with nodes connected by edges, featuring a single root node and potentially many levels of additional nodes.
- **Stack**: A linear data structure that follows a last in, first out (LIFO) order for adding and removing elements.
- **Heap**: A specialized tree-based structure that satisfies the heap property, where the parent node is ordered with respect to its children.
- **Hashing**: A technique used to uniquely identify a specific object from a group of similar objects, typically using hash functions.
- **Queue**: A linear data structure that follows a first in, first out (FIFO) order for adding and removing elements.
- **Sorting**: Algorithms that arrange elements in a specific order, often numerical or lexicographical.


## OJ System üöÄ

The OJ (Online Judge) System folder contains a collection of problem files that have been successfully solved on the system. These files are continuously updated to provide you with the latest challenges and solutions. Within the `OJ` folder, you will find a variety of thought-provoking exercises designed to sharpen your problem-solving skills. Remember, the true value lies in understanding and solving these problems on your own. Avoid the temptation to duplicate these files‚Äîit's like shortchanging your future self. Instead, embrace the spirit of discovery and deduction, much like Sherlock Holmes. Happy coding! üîç


## Midterm üìù

The Midterm folder includes the question and code files from 2024 Spring midterm exams. Currently, it contains the successfully passed code for Questions 2 and 4. Use these resources to review and understand the solutions, ensuring you're well-prepared for future assessments. As we progress, more questions and solutions will be added to enrich your learning experience.


## Usage/Installation üíª

To simplify running the files on VS Code, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/Kirandeephere/CS3334_Data-Structures.git`.
3. Open VS Code and navigate to the cloned repository folder.
4. Open the desired file that you wish to run.
5. Use the appropriate VS Code extension or integrated terminal to compile and execute the file.
